# ðŸ›’ Connect to Your Shopify Store

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Get Your Store URL
Your Shopify store URL format: `yourstore.myshopify.com`

Example: If your store is `https://myboutique.myshopify.com`, use `myboutique.myshopify.com`

### Step 2: Run Development Server

**Option A: Using VS Code Tasks (Recommended)**
1. Press `Ctrl+Shift+P`
2. Type "Tasks: Run Task"
3. Select "Shopify: Start Development Server"
4. Enter your store URL when prompted (e.g., `yourstore.myshopify.com`)
5. Follow the authentication prompts in your browser

**Option B: Using Terminal**
```bash
npm run dev --store=yourstore.myshopify.com
```

### Step 3: Authentication Process
1. The CLI will open your browser for authentication
2. Log in to your Shopify store
3. Grant permissions to the Shopify CLI
4. Return to VS Code - the development server will start

### Step 4: Access Your Development Theme
After successful authentication, you'll see:
- **Local preview**: `http://127.0.0.1:9292` (with live reload)
- **Theme editor**: Link to edit in Shopify admin
- **Preview link**: Shareable preview URL

## Environment Variables (Optional)
Set these to avoid repeated prompts:

```bash
# In your terminal or .env file
export SHOPIFY_FLAG_STORE=yourstore.myshopify.com
```

## Available Commands
